# OpenCV Python Learning Journey (30-Day Challenge)

Welcome to my 30-day intensive learning journey into the world of Computer Vision with OpenCV and Python! This repository documents my daily progress, code snippets, mini-projects, and notes as I go from the basics to more advanced applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ About This Project

The goal of this 30-day challenge is to build a solid foundation in computer vision principles and gain practical experience by completing daily tasks and weekly projects. This repository serves as a personal log and a portfolio of my work.

- **Technology Stack:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Challenge Duration:** 30 Days
- **My Goal:** To be able to build practical computer vision applications and integrate them with other technologies like deep learning.
